I am a PhD student in Applied Mechanics at IIT Delhi with a passion for scalable Bayesian methods, uncertainty quantification, physics-aware deep learning, and Gaussian Processes. My research focuses on developing advanced techniques to solve complex problems in computational physics and engineering. With a strong background in AI and machine learning, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications..
